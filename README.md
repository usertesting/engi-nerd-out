EngiNerdOut
===========

## What is it?

*EngiNerdOut* is a 5 hour long, bi-weekly, intensive practice event, inspired by [CodeRetreat](http://coderetreat.org/), focusing on the fundamentals of software development and design. By providing developers the opportunity to take part in focused practice, away from the pressures of 'getting things done', the coderetreat format has proven itself to be a highly effective means of skill improvement. Practicing the basic principles of modular and object-oriented design, developers can improve their ability to write code that minimizes the cost of change over time.

## EngiNerdOut Structure

*EngiNerdOut* has an established, time-tested format that is optimized for focused practice.

- Problem: Conway's Game of Life
- Length of Session: 45 minutes
- Duration: 9am - 2pm PT (Noon-5pm ET)
- Pair-programming is necessary, as the knowledge transfer contained in that activity is essential to the practice
- Prefer using Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- After each session, pairs should be swapped
- After each session, code must be deleted, not put in a branch, not stashed, just deleted with no trace left

Each 45 minute session's learnings building upon previous sessions. The first focuses on becoming comfortable with the problem domain, breaking old habits and beginning focused self-discovery. The second pushes the envelope by challenging pairs to stretch their skills and understanding of abstractions, modular design and test-driven development.

The focus should be on the fundamentals of software development and modular design, primarily the [4 rules of simple](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?XpSimplicityRules) design. Spend the day practicing these concepts, rather than pushing into new learnings.

Below is a rough outline for the *EngiNerdOut*
- 9:00AM - 9:10AM:   Intro, problem explanation
- 9:10AM - 9:55AM:   Session #1
- 9:55AM - 10:10AM:  Retrospective, break
- 10:10AM - 10:55AM: Session #2
- 10:55AM - 11:10AM: Retrospective, break
- 11:10AM - 11:55AM: Session #3
- 11:55AM - 12:30PM: Retrospective, lunch break
- 12:30PM - 1:15PM:  Session #4
- 1:15PM - 1:30PM:   Retrospective, break
- 1:30PM - 2:00PM:   Closing Circle

## Suggested topics for the Retrospectives

### Session #1 Retro
Allow pairs to get a feel for the problem domain. Not everyone has seen Conway's Game of Life before, so this session will allow them to wrap their head around the task. After the first session, it can sometimes be useful to discuss the idea of deleting the code. Some people might have a bit of resistance to the idea. Gently explain that those are the rules.

### Session #2 Retro
Discuss appropriate data structures around the problem. Is an array the right way to hold the cells? Introduce the idea of primitive obsession. Suggest that teams begin to stretch themselves. Discuss polymorphism as a better solution than boolean flags. Further reinforce the avoidance of [primitive obsession](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PrimitiveObsession). Push heavy exploration of abstractions.

### Session #3, 4 Retro
Explain to teams that the afternoon is about going past any self-imposed limits. Below are some constraints that can be introduced, chosen based on the experience of the individual pairs.

- No if statements
- No loops
- Small Methods (<5 lines, 1-line?)
- No language primitives
- TDD As If You Meant It
 
### The Closing Circle

It is important to get together at the end of the day and reflect. The standard way if to have a closing circle where everyone answers 3 questions. Depending on the size of the group, you'll want to emphasize brevity. With 20-30 people, it can potentially take a while.

### The Three Questions

- What, if anything, did you learn today?
- What, if anything, surprised you today?
- What, if anything, will you do differently in the future?

## Whatever Language You Want!

The ideas presented and practiced in coderetreat are applicable to any object-oriented language. To this end, it is suggested that coderetreats are explicitly multi-lingual. While coderetreat is not a day to learn a new language, it is perfectly acceptable for someone to work in a language they are not familiar with. The facilitator should stress that at least one member of the pair should have a working environment. After all, 45 minutes goes by quickly, and it is a waste to spend the majority of the time getting a development environment raised up.


# Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

![Video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdMzngWchDk)

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, live or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are directly horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed?births and deaths happen simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the one before). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
